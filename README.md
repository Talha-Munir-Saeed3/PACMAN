# üü° Pac-Man AI Project

A Python-based AI-powered Pac-Man game built as part of our semester project. This implementation includes intelligent ghost behavior (scatter, chase, return), a reactive AI using a greedy strategy, and a visually engaging interface to showcase classic gameplay with modern AI features.

## üìñ Introduction

Pac-Man is a classic arcade game where the player navigates a maze, collecting pellets and avoiding ghosts. In this project, we bring Pac-Man to life using Python with advanced AI behavior for the ghost enemies. The ghosts act based on different strategies such as chasing the player, scattering to corners, returning after being eaten, and adapting to player actions through a reactive greedy approach.
